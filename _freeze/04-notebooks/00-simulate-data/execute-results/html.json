Additionally, an example codebook is created, serving as a metadata document that outlines the dataset's contents, structure, and generation process. Simulating data before working with empirical data is a good practice because it allows for testing analytical methods, understanding potential outcomes, and ensuring that the data analysis workflow is robust and error-free. This preparatory step helps in planning and anticipating the needs and challenges of working with empirical data.\n\n**Action steps:**\n\n-   Run the first code chunk to create a sample codebook.\n\n-   Run the second code chunk to simulate and save the raw data.\n\n-   Proceed to the next step: Preparing data with EDA\n\n*Understanding all the details of the code below is not necessary in following the tutorial.*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"View code: Load packages\"}\n# load / install tidyverse package for data manipulation\nif (!requireNamespace(\"tidyverse\", quietly = TRUE)) {install.packages(\"tidyverse\")}\nrequire(tidyverse)\nrequire(here)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Create an example codebook\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"View code: Create codebook\"}\n# Define and create a codebook\ncodebook <- \"\n# Codebook for Longitudinal Baby Steps Dataset\n\n## Dataset Overview\n\n**Title:** Longitudinal Study on Baby Steps and Developmental Progress\n\n**Description:** The dataset follows 100 baby participants across three observation points to monitor how their mobility type (Crawling, Toddling, Walking) affects their ability to solve puzzles and their engagement with the task, as indicated by their giggle counts. The data has three three observation points for each baby. The data is simulated for planning a (fictional) study.\n\n**Author:** Jane Doe\n\n**Creation Date:** March 11, 2024\n\n**Last Updated:** March 12, 2024\n\n**Version:** 1.0\n\n## Contact Information\n\n**Author Contact:** Jane Doe (email)\n\n**Institution:** University of Data Science\n\n## License\n\nThis dataset is made available under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Used as a proxy for enjoyment or engagement.\n    -   Type: Integer\n    -   Example Values: Non-negative values, varying by individual and task.\n\n### Collection Method\n\nData were collected through direct observation of baby participants in a controlled environment, ensuring that puzzle difficulty was consistent across observations.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nThis dataset is intended for research on early childhood development, specifically examining the relationship between motor skills, problem-solving abilities, and engagement in activities.\n\n## Ethics Approval\n\nThis study received ethics approval from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Data Science, approval number #12345.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank the participants and their families for their time and contribution to this study.
